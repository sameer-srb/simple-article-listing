## 💡 My process

### Built with ⚙️
- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS3 Flexbox** for layout  
- **Responsive design** with media queries  
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)** for typography  

### What I learned 📑
- How to structure semantic HTML using `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` elements.  
- Improved my understanding of **Flexbox** for horizontal and vertical alignment.  
- Learned to use **media queries** effectively for responsive layouts.  
- Writing clean and meaningful **CSS comments** for maintainability.  

```css
article {
  display: flex;
  gap: 60px;
  align-items: center;
}
```
